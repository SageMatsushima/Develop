    <h1>Development</h1>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
        During my sophomore fall semester at Brown, my UI/UX class assigned us a project that focused on React and its
        useful applications. As a result, the app focused on components and state properties. The app I created focused
        on the applications React has on online shopping. It is a shop where users can buy Pokemon and add each item to
        the cart. Its designed to be item efficient and helps the user quickly navigate the website to find what they
        desire.

        <!-- Describe the  goal of the application and value to a user -->
    </p>

    <div class="l">
        <a class="link" href="https://fathomless-hamlet-45632.herokuapp.com/">The link to the React App</a>
        <!-- Links to your React App GitHub Repo and deployed React App website -->
    </div>

    <p>
        Some usability principles that I considered was:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>User Control: The user has full freedom of the website and their shopping experience.</li>
        <li>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: Filters and sorting helps the user find what they are looking for.
        </li>
        <li>Error Prevention: Remove buttons and add buttons help the user if they made a mistake or forgot to
            add an item.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Using these principles, my React website was based on the user's experience and the goal for the shopping
        design. The items were clear and the buttons helped prevent any confusion with the interface. It makes it a
        clear design for users that help them focus on their goal and filters out what they don't want for a more
        streamlined experience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
    <p class="ending">
        After learning React and JS firsthand, I feel more comfortable with the program and its applications. I liked
        how simple it could be to make a component and repeat products on a website. It saves time for developers and
        makes it easier to code.
